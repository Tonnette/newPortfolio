# description
This website showcases my writing and directing work including the films Romp - the webseries, The Egg, Milk and Vodka, Love Bytes, Slut- the Musical, Wally, Why Me, The Vicious and the Delicious and Tina Sol.

It also showcases my web developer skills including the group project, Movie Review where users can look up any movie and see member reviews. This could help them decide to watch a movie or not. Secondly, users can register as a member and this allows them to also add their own reviews. They can also go into their profile page and delete any of their reviews that they are not happy with.

 It also showcases a Burger eating app. where users can name all the burgers they want to eat. They can then choose to devour which every burger they want. After they devour their burger, they can then choose to delete the item. This burger app was built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.

 I also showcase our Mixer Upper app - This is a dynamic webpage which provides users an easy and convenient to discover and create sophisticated cocktails. Cocktails can be searched by name or by ingredient, and receive an image of the cocktail, a list of ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it. The page includes buttons to post to Twitter and Facebook, as well as a button to open Google Maps and find the users closest cocktail bar. Materialize was used for CSS, and the header includes the carousel feature, and can be seen mid-change in the first image. Javascript uses the Jquery library, and the Montserrat font family is from Google Fonts. The details for the cocktails are drawn from The Cocktail Database (thecocktaildb.com) through its API.

It also showcases:
- a weather App - This is a weather app that allows the user to find out the weather of any city in the world. It will display today's weather and weather for the up-coming 5 days. It includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name will perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. This app displays the weather conditions:

- The coding quiz website - The quiz will log how many questions you got correct and you will be rewarded if you answer the questions quickly. For any wrong answer there is a time penalty. At the end of the quiz your score is calculated by the time left of the timer. You may log your score in the high scores section and the user also has the ability to clear all high scores.

- Day Planner website - This calendar displays the current date and time and allows the user to put and save items for each hour of the day (between 9am-5pm).
This info will save in local storage. Each hour is colour coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. The colours will change depending on the time of day. Grey for past, pink for present and green for future hours.
